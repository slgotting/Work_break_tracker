In order to start you must use the Work_Times_Template.xls and
save that as what you wish to name your file. 

You must change the worksheets at the bottom to what you wish to 
work on and subsequently change the .py file options part where 
you say '0 for Python', etc.

This program helps you keep track and stay on a consistent work 
schedule for your classes or whatever you wish to work intermittently
on.
